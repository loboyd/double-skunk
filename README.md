# Double-skunk
a simple platform for playing text-based multiplayer cribbage

## Just Getting the Ball Rolling
This project is very new, and as such, does not have much use for installation info and whatnot just yet. The goal of the project is to build a simple text-based platform so that I can play cribbage with a friend over the internet. The application will probably just run in a terminal.

## Ideas Beyond the Short Term
I would also like to use this platform to develop an AI cribbage player. This is partly just out of interest in trying to build a strong AI, but would also be useful to a player looking to play offline.

This project would also be a good candidate to explore some peer-to-peer networking concepts. That might come as a future repo.

## Technology
For the foreseeable future, this project will be built using Python 2.7.
