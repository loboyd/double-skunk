# TODO:
# - come up with a nice way of sorting the hands (It would be really nice if the
#   numbers representing the cards happened to share the preferred ordering of
#   the cards -- this way, the native sorted() could be used.) EDIT -- I think
#   this is working now, but it should probably be double-checked
# - consider breaking this file into "player," "functionality," and "main" files
# - finish "play" and "show" code
# - write a function to count points
# - work on P2P communication over the web (either with library at socket level)
# - write some stand-only documentation (not just comments)
# - further specify the design (in documentation)
# - add some testing
# - finish todo list (probably move the todo list to its own file)
