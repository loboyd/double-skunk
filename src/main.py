# there will probably be something of a "main menu" where users can start a 
# game, update their user info (display name, etc.), add a new peer manually

# find/connect to peer

# exchange info (username and whatever else)

# perform "coin flip" for first dealer (this is not trivial)

# game loop

    # deal cards
    
    # discard to crib

    # pegging phase
    
    # reveal starter card
    
    # count hands
